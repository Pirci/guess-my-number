# Guess My Number Game

This is a JavaScript game that simulates a simple "Guess My Number" game. The
game is about the player trying to guess a randomly selected number.

## Game Rules

The game randomly generates a secret number between 1 and 20. The player's task
is to guess the number by entering their guess in the input field provided.
After each guess, the game provides feedback to the player, letting them know if
their guess was too high or too low. If the player correctly guesses the number,
the game ends and the player wins. If the player runs out of guesses, the game
ends and the player loses.

The game also keeps track of the player's score. The score starts at 20 and
decreases by one with each incorrect guess. If the player wins the game, their
score is compared to their previous high score, and if it is higher, their high
score is updated.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to help learners practice their JavaScript skills by
building a simple game. By completing this project, learners will practice the
following concepts:

## Random number generation

- DOM manipulation
- Event listeners
- Conditional statements
- Functions
- Variables
- How to Play

## How to Play

To play the game:

- Open the "index.html" file in your web browser.
- The game will load, and you will see an input field where you can enter your
  guess.
- Enter a number between 1 and 20 and click the "Check!" button to submit your
  guess.
- The game will provide feedback on whether your guess was too high or too low.
- Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number, or you run out of guesses.
- If you want to start a new game, click the "Again!" button, and the game will
  restart with a new secret number.

## Good luck!
